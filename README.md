Caveat: numerous is currently ***UNDER CONSTRUCTION***.

Thank you for your interest, but this depository currently contains only *pre-beta code*.

It will be of interest mainly to those studying Android development.

numerous demonstrates Android's animation capabilities.
Without resorting to NDK, numerous shows how animations implemented in the Android
SDK can be choreographed for various synchronized effects.

numerous may also reveal performance limits of your device;
though designed for use with all Android devices, some will
work much more smoothly than others due to more advanced platform
software, greater memory, CPU, and/or GPU capacities.  **YMMV!**

In all, four types of animation are used:
 - frame animation of continuously changing random numbers
 - rotation animations to spin colors
 - x animation to rotate the numbers plane in/out
 - lateral animation to move numbers up/down/left/right

See todo's in numerous.java for more details.
